# TemplateAndroidApp

This repository contains an Android template project using a movie database API from TMDb and aims at showing how to use
the three main types of view you may have to use while building an app namely a form, a list and a detail item.

Furthermore this app implements reactive programming through MVVM pattern.

Kotlin, LiveData, ViewModel, Databinding, Dagger, RxJava, Retrofit, Timber, Glide are the main technical tools used for mixing this app.

And for those who enjoy both the taste of a lollipop and an apple you may find the same project developed in iOS right here https://github.com/dovene/TemplateiOSApp.
